## üöÄ Key Features

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **npm** or **Yarn**
- **MongoDB** account (Atlas or self-hosted)
- **Expo CLI** (`npm install -g expo-cli`)
- **Expo Go** app installed on your mobile device (for live testing)

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd VaultVu
```

### 2. Install Frontend Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Install Backend Dependencies

```bash
cd backend
npm install
cd ..
```

### 4. Configure Backend Environment

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add the following variables:

```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
NUMVERIFY_API_KEY=your_numverify_api_key
SPAM_CHECK_API_KEY=your_spam_check_api_key
GOOGLE_SAFE_BROWSING_API_KEY=your_google_safe_browsing_api_key
```

> **Note**: Replace the placeholder values with your actual API keys and MongoDB connection string.

### 5. Update API URL for Mobile Testing

To run the app on your mobile device, update the API URL to match your computer's local IP address in the following files:

- `app/signin.tsx`
- `app/signup.tsx`
- `app/FraudMessageCheckerScreen.tsx`
- `app/URLTheftCheckerScreen.tsx`
- `app/CheckSpamScreen.tsx`

Replace `YOUR_IP_ADDRESS` with your computer's local IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.7`).

**Finding your IP address:**
- Windows: Run `ipconfig` in Command Prompt
- Mac/Linux: Run `ifconfig` in Terminal

## Running the Application

### 1. Start the Backend Server

Open a terminal window and run:

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

The server will start on port 5000 (or the port specified in your `.env` file).

### 2. Start the Frontend

In a new terminal window, run:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the Expo development server and display a QR code.

### 3. Run on Your Mobile Device

1. Install the **Expo Go** app on your mobile device
2. Ensure your mobile device is connected to the same Wi-Fi network as your computer
3. Scan the QR code with your camera (iOS) or the Expo Go app (Android)

## Date Picker Setup

The app uses `@react-native-community/datetimepicker` for date selection during the signup process.

### Installation

```bash
npm install @react-native-community/datetimepicker --save
```

### Platform Behavior

- **Android**: Date picker appears when you tap the date field and disappears after selection
- **iOS**: Date picker remains visible, and you must press "Done" to confirm selection

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

If your mobile device cannot connect to the backend server:

- Ensure both devices are on the same Wi-Fi network
- Check if your computer's firewall is blocking the connection
- Verify that you've updated all API URLs with your correct IP address
- Try restarting both the backend and Expo development servers

### Date Picker Issues

If the date picker doesn't appear or work correctly:

- Make sure you've installed all required dependencies
- For Android, verify you're using the correct implementation as shown in `signup2.tsx`
- Try clearing the Expo cache:

```bash
expo r -c
```
